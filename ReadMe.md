# Color Flipper Project

The Color Flipper is a simple web application that allows users to change the background color of a webpage by clicking a button. 
It provides two modes: Simple and Hex, which generate background colors in different formats.

## Features

- Simple Mode: Cycles through a predefined list of colors.
- Hex Mode: Generates random hex color codes.
- Displays the current background color code on the screen.
- Responsive design, ensuring compatibility across different devices.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: For structuring the application.
- CSS: For styling the application, including animations and responsiveness.
- JavaScript: For dynamic color generation and event handling.

## How It Works

1. Simple Mode:
   - Predefined colors are stored in an array.
   - Clicking the button selects a random color from the array and updates the background and the displayed color code.

2. Hex Mode:
   - Hex color codes are generated by randomly selecting 6 characters (0-9, A-F).
   - Clicking the button generates a random hex color and updates the background and the displayed color code.
